        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition that affects women of reproductive age. It usually starts during adolescence, but symptoms may fluctuate over time.</p>
        <p>PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, excess androgen levels, and cysts in the ovaries. Irregular periods, usually with a lack of ovulation, can make it difficult to become pregnant. PCOS is a leading cause of infertility.</p>
        <p>PCOS is a chronic condition and cannot be cured. However, some symptoms can be improved through lifestyle changes, medications, and fertility treatments. The cause of PCOS is unknown, but women with a family history or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy, long, intermittent, unpredictable, or absent periods</li>
            <li>Infertility</li>
            <li>Acne or oily skin</li>
            <li>Excessive hair on the face or body</li>
            <li>Male-pattern baldness or hair thinning</li>
            <li>Weight gain, especially around the belly</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>PCOS is diagnosed by the presence of at least two of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Signs or symptoms of high androgens (unwanted facial or bodily hair, hair loss from the head, acne, or elevated blood levels of testosterone)</li>
            <li>Irregular or absent menstrual periods (after excluding other causes)</li>
            <li>Polycystic ovaries on an ultrasound scan</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>There is no cure for PCOS, but treatments can improve symptoms. Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, can help reduce weight and decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
        <p>Birth control pills (contraceptives) can regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce symptoms. Other medications can help reduce acne and unwanted hair growth.</p>
        <p>For infertility caused by PCOS, treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery to stimulate ovulation. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) may be used but carries some risks.</p>
