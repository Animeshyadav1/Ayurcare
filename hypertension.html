            <h2>Key Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Approximately 1.28 billion adults aged 30–79 years have hypertension.</li>
                <li>46% of adults with hypertension are unaware of their condition.</li>
                <li>42% of individuals with hypertension are diagnosed and treated.</li>
                <li>21% of people with hypertension have it under control.</li>
                <li>Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.</li>
                <li>The global target is to reduce hypertension prevalence by 33% by 2030.</li>

        <section class="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Hypertension is a condition where blood pressure is too high (≥140/90 mmHg). It is common and can be serious if untreated, as it may cause heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage.</p>
            <p>People with hypertension often don’t feel symptoms, so regular blood pressure checks are important.</p>
