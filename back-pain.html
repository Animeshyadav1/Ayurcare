        <h2>Overview of Back Pain</h2>
        <p>Back pain is one of the most common medical problems in the United States. It can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain that may shoot down the leg. Sometimes it can come on suddenly – from an accident, a fall, or lifting something heavy, or it can develop slowly because of age-related degenerative changes in the spine. In some cases, inflammatory arthritis disorders or other medical conditions cause back pain.</p>
        <p>Treatment varies depending on the cause and symptoms, and often there are several contributing factors. However, there are steps you can take to improve your health and lower your chance of developing chronic or long-lasting back pain.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Anatomy of the Back</h2>
        <p>The spine consists of several key structures that work together to support your body and help you move. Problems with any one of these structures can cause back pain.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cervical spine</li>
            <li>Thoracic spine</li>
            <li>Lumbar spine</li>
            <li>Sacrum and coccyx</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other important parts of the back include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vertebrae – bones that protect the spinal cord.</li>
            <li>Spinal cord – bundle of nerves running through the vertebrae.</li>
            <li>Intervertebral discs – cushion-like pads between vertebrae.</li>
            <li>Ligaments – tissue bands that hold vertebrae in place.</li>
            <li>Tendons – connect muscles to bones.</li>
            <li>Muscles – fibers that support the spine and help movement.</li>
        </ul>
